In February 2024, both [Gmail](https://blog.google/products/gmail/gmail-security-authentication-spam-protection/) and [Yahoo](https://blog.postmaster.yahooinc.com/post/737268108173230080/an-update-on-enforcing-email-standards) have implemented new email requirements. If you are a frequent email marketing sender, sending over 5000 emails per day, it is strongly advised to comply with the following requirements provided by these email service providers. Here are key factors to affect email marketing performance: 

## 1. Authenticate your domain name and sender email address:
If you have a domain name for your online store, such as myABCshop.com, you should access the website domain DNS dashboard and configure SPF and DKIM values to complete the verification process. Omnisend, our recommended email service provider, offers a clear and straightforward walkthrough for this verification process. You can find a helpful video tutorial here:

## 2. Provide an easy email unsubscribe option
Make sure to include a one-click unsubscribe button in the footer of your emails. This allows recipients to easily opt-out of receiving further emails from your store.

## 3. Maintain a spam rate below 0.3%
Regularly review your email lists and remove contacts that result in hard and soft bounces. This helps keep your spam rate low and ensures that your emails reach the intended recipients' inboxes.

## 4. Carefully consider your email content
Ensure that your email content is valuable, relevant, and easily readable. Avoid sending spammy or unwanted materials, as recipients prefer engaging with useful and meaningful content.

Yahoo mail service also provides [best practices](https://senders.yahooinc.com/best-practices/) for email senders, which you should consider implementing alongside the email marketing requirements in 2024.

Remember to complete the verification process by the end of February to meet the email requirements set by Gmail and Yahoo. If you encounter any difficulties or have questions regarding email marketing, please free feel to [contact us](/contact/) for consultation.
