## The Challenges E-commerce Businesses Face: How to Retain Customers?
E-commerce businesses often struggle with the following issues:

1. Customers make a single purchase but never return.
2. Marketing campaigns underperform, resulting in low conversion rates.
3. Lack of time and resources to implement personalized marketing strategies.
4. The root cause of these problems is the lack of effective customer engagement and follow-up mechanisms. This is where Omnisend’s Automated Email Marketing comes into play.
