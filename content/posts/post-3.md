The answer is definitely yes. And, as a digital specialist, we are pretty sure that emails will still hold its place for a very long time. Email marketing is still an essential strategy for e-commerce merchants due to its effectiveness in driving sales, building customer relationships, and maximizing revenue in 2024.

## Do you know how many emails sent by day in 2024?

> *361.1 billions per day*, from [Oberlo](https://www.oberlo.com/statistics/how-many-emails-are-sent-per-day)

Even though instant messengers are blooming, email usage has not been affected. The trend is expected to increase by 3-4% annually across this century.

## 1. Direct and Personalized Communication
Email allows you to have direct and personalized communication with your customers. By sending targeted emails, you can tailor your messages to specific customer segments based on their preferences, purchase history, and behavior. Personalization creates a sense of relevance and enhances the customer experience, leading to higher engagement and conversion rates.

## 2. Cost-Effective Channel

Email marketing is a cost-effective marketing channel compared to traditional methods like print advertising or direct mail. With minimal expenses, you can reach a large number of customers instantly. Additionally, automation tools like Omnisend enable you to set up automated email campaigns, saving time and effort while delivering personalized messages at scale.

## 3. Increased Sales and Conversions

Email marketing has consistently proven to be a powerful tool for driving sales and conversions. By sending targeted emails with compelling offers, product recommendations, and exclusive promotions, you can encourage customers to make purchases. Additionally, abandoned cart emails can help recover lost sales by reminding customers to complete their purchase.

## 4. Customer Retention and Loyalty

Email marketing plays a crucial role in nurturing customer relationships and fostering loyalty. By sending regular newsletters, product updates, and personalized recommendations, you can stay top-of-mind with your customers, encouraging repeat purchases and building long-term loyalty. A loyal customer base translates into increased customer lifetime value and a higher likelihood of positive word-of-mouth referrals.

## 5. Data-Driven Insights and Optimization

Email marketing provides valuable data and insights that can help you optimize your e-commerce business. Through analytics and reporting, you can track key metrics such as open rates, click-through rates, and conversion rates. These insights allow you to measure the success of your campaigns, identify areas for improvement, and make data-driven decisions to enhance your marketing strategies.

## 6. Retargeting Opportunities

Email marketing enables you to retarget customers who have shown interest in your products or services. By segmenting your email list based on customer behaviour, you can send targeted emails to those who have abandoned their carts or browsed specific product categories. This personalized approach increases the chances of converting those potential customers into actual buyers.

## Email marketing is still vital in 2024

All in all, email marketing offers e-commerce shop owners a cost-effective and powerful tool to drive sales, build customer relationships, and boost revenue. By leveraging personalized communication, automation, and data-driven insights, businesses can effectively engage with their audience and achieve long-term success in the competitive e-commerce landscape.
