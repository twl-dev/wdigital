## Client Overview
- Client: AC Home
- Industry: Air Conditioning Services
- Location: Hong Kong 

[AC Home](https://www.achomehk.com) specializes in air conditioning cleaning and repair services, catering to both residential and corporate clients. They approached us to enhance their online visibility and generate more leads through effective SEO and SEM strategies.

## Job Requirements

AC Home aimed to:
1. Improve lead generation through optimized SEO and SEM strategies.
2. Encourage potential customers to send requests via WhatsApp and submit inquiry forms on their website.
3. Shift focus from broad keywords like "Cleaning Air Con" to more specific, high-intent keywords that would yield better results.

## Challenges

The initial strategy focused on the highly competitive keyword "Cleaning Air Con," which proved difficult due to its broad nature. The search volume for this keyword was low in terms of lead generation intent, leading to suboptimal results.

## Strategy Implementation

### Keyword Optimization

To address the challenges, we conducted a thorough keyword analysis and shifted focus to the following high-intent keywords:
1. "Repairing Air Con"
2. "Fixing Air Con Leaking Water"
3. "Fix Air Condition Dripping"
4. "Clogged Drainage Line of AC"
These keywords not only had significantly larger search volumes but also lower CPC values, making them more cost-effective for lead generation.

### Youtube Video Marketing

We have developed [tutorial videos](https://www.youtube.com/@achome/videos) and published them on Youtube, which are effectively for video SEO and youtube advertising.

### SEO and SEM Tactics
#### On-Page SEO:

- Optimized website content to include targeted keywords.
- Improved meta tags, headers, and alt texts for images.
- Enhanced user experience with faster loading times and mobile optimization.


#### Content Marketing:
- Created informative blog posts around the targeted keywords, addressing common issues and solutions related to air conditioning.
- Developed guides and FAQs that encouraged user engagement and positioned AC Home as an industry authority.

For example, the blog post about [how to prevent from installation a split-type AC mistakenly](https://www.achomehk.com/post/%E9%81%BF%E5%85%8D%E5%AE%89%E8%A3%9D%E5%88%86%E9%AB%94%E5%BC%8F%E5%86%B7%E6%B0%A3%E6%A9%9F%E4%B8%AD%E4%BC%8F-ac-home-%E5%86%B7%E6%B0%A3%E5%B8%AB%E5%82%85%E6%8B%86%E8%A7%A3%E8%A6%81%E6%B1%82) hits to the top of the SERP. Its click-through rate is abnormally high up to 20%! SMEs have to secure such long-tailed keywords in order to surpass big media websites. 


#### SEM Campaigns:
- Launched Google Ads campaigns targeting the new keywords.
- Utilized ad extensions to include direct links for WhatsApp inquiries and form submissions.
- Implemented A/B testing on ad copy to identify the most effective messaging.

#### Social Media Integration:
- Promoted content through social media channels, encouraging users to engage via WhatsApp.
- Created targeted Facebook ads that led users directly to the inquiry form on the website.

## Outcome
The strategic shift resulted in:
- A 15-20% reduction in CPC, making advertising more cost-effective.
Sustained traction in lead requests during low seasons, with a consistent flow of inquiries through both WhatsApp and the submission form.
- Increased visibility for targeted keywords, leading to higher organic traffic and conversions.
